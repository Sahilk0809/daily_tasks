## Description

A simple Flutter app designed to allow users to log in and view their profile details. The app features a login screen with a blue-themed UI, where users can enter their username and password. Upon successful login, users are directed to a home screen where their profile details such as name, username, email, and other personal information are displayed in a clean and attractive layout. The app uses Provider for state management, ensuring smooth data handling. The UI is minimalistic yet user-friendly, focusing on a seamless experience for viewing user profile data.
